VQMod 2.5.1.6 for OpenCart 2.0.3.1
==================================

This package provides a XML-controlled search and add/replace modification system for OpenCart 2.0 core files. 
In addition to OpenCart's OCMod XML you can now also use the VQMod XML for describing the modifications.

See also the documentations at

<https://code.google.com/p/vqmod/wiki/Scripting>

and

<https://github.com/opencart/opencart/wiki/Modification-System>

for more details on the XML syntaxes.





Installation
============

Simply upload the folders and files from the 'upload' directory to your OpenCart server's main directory.

The following OpenCart files are replaced by the upload:

admin/controller/extension/installer.php
admin/controller/extension/modification.php

 



How to upload OpenCart modifications
====================================

There are 4 ways to upload modifications to an OpenCart server:

1)
Use the OpenCart admin backend at Extensions > Extension Installer to upload individual XML files to the OpenCart database. 
The XML file names must end with '.vqmod.xml' or '.ocmod.xml' depending on the type of XML used.

2)     
Use the OpenCart admin backend at Extensions > Extension Installer to upload zipped OpenCart extensions 
which include an XML file (the latter ends up in the OpenCart database). 
The name of the ZIP-file to be uploaded must end with '.vqmod.zip' or '.ocmod.zip'. 
The folders and files structure of the ZIP-file should look like this:

    upload/*
    install.xml (can contain VQmod or OCmod XML)
    install.php (optional)
    install.sql (optional)

3)     
Use FTP to upload XML files directly to OpenCart's system folder. 
The XML file names must end with '.vqmod.xml' or '.ocmod.xml' depending on the type of XML used.

4)     
Use FTP to upload VQmod XML files directly to OpenCart's vqmod/xml folder. The file names must end with '.xml'.

Note: Option 4) is useful for many legacy OpenCart extensions that come as ZIP-files, 
and that require VQmod. The content of such a ZIP-archive is usually first to be extracted on a local computer,
and then everything from the extracted 'upload' folder is uploaded to OpenCart's main folder. 
     

After the OpenCart modifications are uploaded, it is important to go into the OpenCart admin backend at 
Extensions > Modifications and then click on the 'Refresh' button. 
This will re-create a cache for all modified OpenCart core files in the system/modification folder.
